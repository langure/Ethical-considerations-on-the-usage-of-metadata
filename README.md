With the rapid rise of emotion detection using AI in mental health monitoring there is a tension between the benefits (early detection, intervention, etc.) and the ethical challenges (privacy, consent, bias, etc.) involved in using metadata.

# DATASET:

The ISEAR (International Survey on Emotion Antecedents and Reactions)

From the Original source: 

"Over a period of many years during the 1990s, a large group of psychologists all over the world collected data in the ISEAR project, directed by Klaus R. Scherer and Harald Wallbott. Student respondents, both psychologists and non-psychologists, were asked to report situations in which they had experienced all of 7 major emotions (joy, fear, anger, sadness, disgust, shame, and guilt). In each case, the questions covered the way they had appraised the situation and how they reacted. The final data set thus contained reports on seven emotions each by close to 3000 respondents in 37 countries on all 5 continents."
